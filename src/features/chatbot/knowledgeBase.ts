First, the climate case: greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, and the buildup from industrial activity since the 1800s is driving measurable warming, more extreme weather, and rising seas — all of which disrupt supply chains and raw-material availability. Second, the business case: international buyers (especially in garment and textile exporting) increasingly require emissions disclosure as part of sourcing decisions, and regulations like the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism are starting to price imported carbon directly. Third, the cost case: most of the actions that cut emissions — fixing leaks, insulating steam lines, upgrading motors — also cut your fuel and electricity bills. Measuring first is what makes all three of those manageable instead of guesswork.",

In moderation this is what makes Earth habitable at all; the problem is that industrial activity has sharply increased the concentration of these gases, trapping more heat than the climate system is adapted to.
